## Intro

Howdy! I'm Jake. This is my project, the G10 game engine. 

You can use the G10 game engine to create 3D games. Examples of other game engines include, Unreal®, Unity®, or Source®. These are often very large projects that manage gigabytes of assets on the filesystem and require auxiliary programs, like map editors, to be useful. This project is no exception.

There are three main components of G10

> [G10 (The Engine)](https://github.com/Jacob-C-Smith/G10-Vulkan)
>
> [GPort (The Import/Exporter)](https://github.com/Jacob-C-Smith/GPort)
>
> [G10 Schema (JSON Schema)](https://github.com/Jacob-C-Smith/G10-Schema)

G10 Schema is a set of JSON schemas descring valid nontemporal game data. In other words, anything stored on the disk, such as scenes, game and server configuration, models, textures, animation, shaders, etc.
